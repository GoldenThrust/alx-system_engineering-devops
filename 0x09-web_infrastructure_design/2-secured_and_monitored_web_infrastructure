You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
1. Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
SSL termination can expose decrypted data internally, reducing security.

2. Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Single point of failure for write operation

3. Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
Homogeneous components can lead to a common vulnerability affecting all servers.
