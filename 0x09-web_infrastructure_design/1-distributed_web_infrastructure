1. For every additional element, why you are adding it

To minimise issue like SPOF

2. What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works

The load balancer is configured with a Round Robin distribution algorithm. This algorithm sends incoming requests to each server in a cyclic manner.

3. Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
The load balancer enables an Active-Active setup where all servers are actively serving traffic, sharing the load evenly unlike the active-Passive setup.

4. How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works

The database Primary-Replica cluster provides data redundancy, high availability, and load distribution for the database.

5. What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
The primary database node handles writes and updates, while the replicate  nodes replicate data fro
m the primary node to serve read requests.

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
1. Where are SPOF

Although the load balancer increases redundancy, if it fails, the entire system can become inaccessible.

2. Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)

Lack of firewall and HTTPS poses security risks, potentially exposing sensitive data and allowing unauthorized access.
3. No monitoring
Without proper monitoring, it's difficult to identify and address issues
